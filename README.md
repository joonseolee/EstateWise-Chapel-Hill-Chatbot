### AI Techniques

**EstateWise** combines a modern API, real‑time chat, and a responsive UI with a powerful AI stack to deliver hyper‑personalized property recommendations:

- **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG):** Uses Pinecone for kNN‑based vector retrieval, then fuses retrieved data into generated responses.
- **k‑Means Clustering:** Automatically groups similar listings and finds closest matches to refine recommendations.
  - All features are also normalized to a range of 0-1 for better clustering and kNN performance.
- **Decision AI Agent:** Decides whether to fetch RAG data (via `queryProperties`); if yes, it pulls in the Pinecone results, otherwise it skips straight to the Mixture‑of‑Experts pipeline.
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE):** Dynamically routes each query through a master model to select specialized sub‑models (Data Analyst, Lifestyle Concierge, Financial Advisor, Neighborhood Expert, Cluster Analyst) for maximal relevance.
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Each expert uses a CoT approach to break down complex queries into manageable steps, ensuring accurate and relevant responses.
- **Feedback Loop & Reinforcement Learning:** Users rate responses; thumbs‑up/down adjust expert weights per conversation, and the system continuously learns to improve accuracy.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Each expert has a unique prompt template, ensuring tailored responses based on user input.
  - All experts, agents, and merger have a detailed and ultra-specific prompt template to ensure the best possible responses.
- **kNN & Cosine Similarity:** Uses Pinecone for fast, real‑time property retrieval based on user queries.

## Features

EstateWise is packed with both UI and AI features to enhance your home-finding experience:

- **Intelligent Property Recommendations**  
  Get tailored property suggestions powered by AI and Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG).

- **Secure User Authentication**  
  Sign up, log in, and log out with JWT‑based security.

- **Conversation History**

  - **Authenticated users** can view, rename, and delete past chats.
  - **Guest users** still have their conversation history saved locally in the browser.

- **Full‑Text Search**  
  Quickly search your conversation history for keywords, topics, or specific properties.

- **Rating System & Feedback Loop**  
  Rate each AI response (thumbs up/down) to adjust expert weights and continuously improve recommendations.

- **Mixture‑of‑Experts (MoE) & Manual Expert View**

  - The AI dynamically routes queries through specialized experts (Data Analyst, Lifestyle Concierge, Financial Advisor, Neighborhood Expert, Cluster Analyst).
  - There is a master merger model that synthesizes the responses from all experts.
  - Optionally switch to any single expert’s view to see their raw recommendation.

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**  
  Each expert uses a CoT approach to break down complex queries into manageable steps, ensuring accurate and relevant responses.

- **Interactive Visualizations**

  - In‑chat, the AI generates live Chart.js graphs from Pinecone data so you can instantly see trends and distributions.
  - A dedicated Visualizations page offers aggregate charts and insights for all Chapel Hill properties.

- **Clustering & Similarity Search**

  - k‑Means clustering groups similar properties for more focused suggestions.
  - kNN & Cosine Similarity (via Pinecone) finds the closest matches to your query in real time.
  - Graph traversal (via Neo4j) adds explainable relationships like same neighborhood/zip and vector‑similar links, enabling statements like “Recommended because it’s in the same neighborhood and similar in price/size to a liked home.”

- **Insights & Tools Page**  
  A dedicated page at `/insights` with:
  - Explain Relationship: shortest graph path between two homes (ZIP/Neighborhood/Similarity edges) with a mini node‑edge diagram.
  - Graph Similar Properties: reasoned similarities (same neighborhood/zip/similar‑to) with a radial node graph.
  - Neighborhood Stats: counts and averages for a named neighborhood.
  - Mortgage & Affordability tools: interactive breakdown + quick utilities.

- **Map Page**  
  A map view at `/map` that displays properties with markers:
  - Accepts `?zpids=123,456` to show specific homes only.
  - If no `zpids`, accepts `?q=` to search and caps to a safe max (200) for performance.
  - Chat replies auto‑include a “View on Map” link when Zillow property links are present.

- **Smooth Animations**  
  Engaging transitions and micro‑interactions powered by Framer Motion.

- **Interactive Chat Interface**  
  Enjoy a fully animated chat experience with Markdown‑formatted responses, collapsible expert views, and inline charts.

- **Responsive, Themeable UI**

  - Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
  - Dark and light modes with your preference saved locally.

- **Guest Mode**  
  Use the app without creating an account—history is stored only in your browser.

- **Comprehensive Property Data**
  - **Over 50,000** Chapel Hill area listings, complete with prices, beds, baths, living area, year built, and more.
  - For security, this data isn’t included in the repo—please plug in your own.
  - Peek at our sample dataset here:  
    [Google Drive CSV (50k+ records)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vJCSlQgnQyVxoINosfWJWl6Jg1f0ltyo/view?usp=sharing)

- **Production-Ready DevOps & Multi-Cloud Delivery**  
  - Turn-key deployments for **AWS (ECS Fargate)**, **Azure (Container Apps)**, **GCP (Cloud Run)**, and **HashiCorp Terraform + Kubernetes (Consul/Nomad mesh)**.  
  - Built-in support for **Vercel** (frontend + optional backend edge) and **kustomize/Helm** manifests for any Kubernetes cluster.  
  - CI/CD ready with **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, **Azure Pipelines**, and **Cloud Build**.  
  - See [DEPLOYMENTS.md](DEPLOYMENTS.md) for diagrams, step-by-step guides, and environment toggles.
  - After cleaning, approx. **30,772 properties** remain in the database, available for the chatbot to use.
  - Explore `Initial-Data-Analysis.ipynb` in the repo root for an initial, quick Jupyter‑powered dive into the data.
  - Explore `EDA-CLI-Chatbot.ipynb` in the repo root for a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of the data, as well as a CLI version of our chatbot.

#### Neo4j Graph Integration

The graph database layer is optional. If enabled, it adds explicit relationship modeling between properties, neighborhoods, and zip codes,

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/neo4j.png" alt="Neo4j Graph Integration" width="100%" />
</p>

The graph layer enhances explainability by allowing the AI to reference relationships like "same neighborhood" or "similar properties" in its recommendations.

**Neo4j integration details:**

- What it adds
  - Explicit relationship modeling: `(Property)‑[:IN_ZIP|IN_NEIGHBORHOOD]->(...)` and optional `(:Property)‑[:SIMILAR_TO]->(:Property)`.
  - New API endpoints under `/api/graph` for explainable recommendations and path explanations.
  - Optional graph context appended to chat responses for better explainability when Neo4j is configured.

- Configure (env)
  - `NEO4J_ENABLE=true`
  - `NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://<your-instance-id>.databases.neo4j.io`
  - `NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j`
  - `NEO4J_PASSWORD=<paste-once-admin-password>`
  - `NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j` (optional)

- Ingest data
  - `cd backend`
  - `npm run graph:ingest` (uses `INGEST_LIMIT` to cap batch)

- Endpoints
  - `GET /api/graph/similar/:zpid?limit=10` → graph‑based similar properties + reasons (same neighborhood/zip, similar edge).
  - `GET /api/graph/explain?from=<zpid>&to=<zpid>` → shortest path explanation between two properties.
  - `GET /api/graph/neighborhood/:name?limit=50` → stats + sample properties in a neighborhood.

Note: The graph layer is optional. If not configured, the API gracefully responds with 503 for graph routes and the chat pipeline skips graph context.

Example managed credentials
- Username: `neo4j`
- Password: paste your one‑time admin password from Neo4j Aura (e.g., the one you saved when provisioning)
- URI: from your Neo4j Aura instance (e.g., `neo4j+s://<id>.databases.neo4j.io`)

## Setup & Installation

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hoangsonww/EstateWise-Chapel-Hill-Chatbot.git
   cd EstateWise-Chapel-Hill-Chatbot/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following variables (adjust as needed):

   ```env
    PORT=<your_port>
    MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_uri>
    JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
    GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=<your_google_ai_api_key>
    PINECONE_API_KEY=<your_pinecone_api_key>
    PINECONE_INDEX=estatewise-index
    NEO4J_ENABLE=false
    NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://<your-instance-id>.databases.neo4j.io
    NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
    NEO4J_PASSWORD=<paste-once-admin-password>
    NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
    INGEST_LIMIT=30772
    
    # Speed & reliability tuning for Pinecone -> Neo4j ingest
    # Max IDs per page (serverless only). Range 1..1000
    PINECONE_PAGE_SIZE=1000
    # Auto-resume from checkpoint after failures
    INGEST_RESUME=true
    # Optional starting token to resume from a specific point (overrides checkpoint)
    PINECONE_START_TOKEN=
    # Checkpoint file path (optional). Default: .neo4j_ingest_checkpoint.json in backend/
    INGEST_CHECKPOINT_FILE=
    # Overwrite behavior for Neo4j before ingest:
    # - set to "all" to delete ALL nodes (destructive)
    # - set to any non-empty value (e.g., "true") to delete only Property/Zip/Neighborhood
    NEO4J_RESET=true
    # Increase write retries for transient disconnects
    NEO4J_WRITE_RETRIES=7
    # Namespace for Pinecone (leave blank for default)
    PINECONE_NAMESPACE=
   ```

   Important: Be sure that you created the Pinecone index with the name `estatewise-index` in your Pinecone account before proceeding. Then,
   add data to the index using the `pinecone` CLI or API. For security purposes, our properties data is not publicly available in the repository. Please use your own data.

4. **Upsert Properties Data to Pinecone:**  
   Use the `upsertProperties.ts` script to upsert your properties data into the Pinecone index. This script assumes that you place the 4 JSON files in the same directory as the script itself,
   under the names `Zillow-March2025-dataset_part0.json`, `Zillow-March2025-dataset_part1.json`, `Zillow-March2025-dataset_part2.json`, and `Zillow-March2025-dataset_part3.json`.

   ```bash
   ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/scripts/upsertProperties.ts
   ```

   Alternatively, and preferably, you can use the following NPM command from the `backend` directory to quickly upsert the properties data:

   ```bash
   npm run upsert
   ```

   Note that it may take quite long to upsert all the 30,772 properties data into the Pinecone index, so please be patient.

5. **Run the Backend in Development Mode:** After the properties data has been upserted into the Pinecone index, you can run the backend server in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command starts the backend server with live reloading.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the client folder:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

3. **Run the Frontend Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend should be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Change API URL:**  
   If your backend is running on a different port or domain, update the API URL in the frontend code (simply CTRL + F or CMD + F and search for our official backend API URL in all frontend files, then replace it with your backend URL - by default it is `http://localhost:3001`).

5. **View and Interact with the App:**  
   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app. You can interact with the chatbot, sign up, log in, and explore the features.

> [!CAUTION]
> As you develop, before committing, we recommend running the linter and formatter to ensure code quality with `npm run format`. This will format your code according to the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations.

## Dockerization

To run the application **(OPTIONAL)** using Docker:

1. Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
2. In the project root directory, run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This command builds and starts both the backend and frontend services as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

However, you don't need to run the app using Docker. You can run the backend and frontend separately as described in the **Setup & Installation** section.

## Prometheus Monitoring & Visualizations

Prometheus is used for monitoring the backend server. It collects metrics from the server and provides a web interface to visualize them.

Metrics collected & visualized include:

- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Heap usage
- Load average
- Event loops
- Requests per second
- Status codes
- Response times

To view our live server metrics, go to [this link](https://estatewise-backend.vercel.app/metrics) in your browser. This will show you the raw metrics of our server collected by Prometheus. If you are running the app locally, you can go to `http://localhost:3001/metrics` in your browser.

To view our live server data, go to [this URL](https://estatewise-backend.vercel.app/status) in your browser. If you are running the app locally, you can go to `http://localhost:3001/status` in your browser.

</p>

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) of the application. It automatically runs tests, builds the Docker images, and deploys the application to Vercel or AWS whenever changes are pushed to the main branch or when pull requests are created.

To view the GitHub Actions workflow, go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/hoangsonww/EstateWise-Chapel-Hill-Chatbot/actions) of this repository. You can see the status of the latest runs, view logs, and check for any errors.

Our pipeline is set up to run the following steps:

* **Linting:** Runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues, enforcing consistent standards across the codebase.
* **Formatting:** Uses Prettier to automatically format code according to project style guidelines.
* **Testing:** Executes unit tests for both the backend (Jest) and frontend (Jest), ensuring that all functionality works as expected.
* **End-to-End Testing:** Runs Cypress and Selenium tests to validate user interactions in a real browser environment.
* **Security Scanning:** Includes CodeQL analysis, `npm audit`, Semgrep, and license checks to detect known vulnerabilities and license conflicts.
* **Build:** Compiles both the frontend and backend code, preparing optimized production artifacts.
* **Database Connectivity Check:** Validates that environment database credentials are correct and that the app can reach its database instances.
* **Performance Testing:** Runs Lighthouse for web performance metrics and Artillery for load testing of critical endpoints.
* **Docker Publishing:** Builds and pushes Docker images for both the frontend and backend to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Uses Trivy to scan Docker images for security issues before deployment.
* **Documentation Generation:** Builds JSDoc and TypeDoc documentation and stores the results as build artifacts.
* **Deployment:** Automates infrastructure deployments to AWS and application deployments to Vercel.
* **Final Confirmation:** Marks the pipeline as successfully completed after all previous steps pass.

This ensures that the application is always in a deployable state and that any issues are caught early in the development process.

## MCP Server

Bring EstateWise data, graphs, analytics, and utilities to MCP‑compatible clients (IDEs/assistants) via the `mcp/` package.

![MCP](https://img.shields.io/badge/MCP-Server-6E56CF?style=for-the-badge&logo=modelcontextprotocol) ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) ![Zod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zod-3068B7?style=for-the-badge&logo=zod&logoColor=white)

- Location: `mcp/`
- Transport: stdio (works with typical MCP launchers)
- Tools (highlights):
  - Properties: `properties.search`, `properties.searchAdvanced`, `properties.lookup`, `properties.byIds`, `properties.sample`
  - Graph: `graph.similar`, `graph.explain`, `graph.neighborhood`, `graph.similarityBatch`, `graph.comparePairs`, `graph.pathMatrix`
  - Charts & Analytics: `charts.priceHistogram`, `analytics.summarizeSearch`, `analytics.groupByZip`, `analytics.distributions`
  - Map: `map.linkForZpids`, `map.buildLinkByQuery`
  - Utilities & Finance: `util.extractZpids`, `util.zillowLink`, `util.summarize`, `util.parseGoal`, `finance.mortgage`, `finance.affordability`, `finance.schedule`

```

Build & run
```
cd mcp
npm run build
npm start
```

Notes
- Returns are text content blocks; JSON payloads are stringified for portability across clients.
- Graph tools require the backend to have Neo4j configured; otherwise they may return 503 from the API.

> [!TIP]
> **For details and examples, see [mcp/README.md](mcp/README.md).**

## Agentic AI Pipeline

A production-ready, multi‑agent CLI with three runtimes to drive research and analysis with tools:

- Orchestrator (default): Round‑based, MCP‑first agents using a shared blackboard.
- LangChain + LangGraph: Tool‑calling ReAct agent with MCP, Pinecone, and Neo4j tools.
- CrewAI (Python): Sequential crew for planning, analysis, graph insights, finance, and reporting.

Location
- `agentic-ai/`

Agents (orchestrator runtime)
- Planner, Coordinator, ZpidFinder, PropertyAnalyst, AnalyticsAnalyst, GraphAnalyst, DedupeRanking, MapAnalyst, FinanceAnalyst, Compliance, Reporter
- Coordination: Shared blackboard (ZPIDs, parsed filters, analytics, links, finance) with retries and JSON normalization.

Quick start (Orchestrator)
```
cd mcp && npm run build
cd ../agentic-ai && npm run dev "Find 3-bed homes in Chapel Hill, NC; explain 123456 vs 654321; estimate $600k at 6.25%."
```

LangGraph runtime
```
cd agentic-ai
npm run dev -- --langgraph "Compare 123456 vs 654321 and show a map"
# or AGENT_RUNTIME=langgraph npm run dev -- "..."
```

CrewAI runtime
```
cd agentic-ai/crewai
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
cd ..
npm run dev -- --crewai "Find 3-bed homes in Chapel Hill; explain two ZPIDs and estimate mortgage"
```

Notes
- Orchestrator spawns `mcp/dist/server.js` over stdio; extend by adding MCP tools in `mcp/` and agents in `agentic-ai/src/agents/`.
- LangGraph adds Pinecone vector retrieval and Neo4j Cypher QA; see `agentic-ai/src/lang/`.
- CrewAI is optional and requires Python with the deps in `agentic-ai/crewai/requirements.txt`.

### When to Use Each API

| API | Best For | Protocol | Type Safety | Languages |
|-----|----------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **REST** | Web standards, wide compatibility | JSON/HTTP/1.1 | OpenAPI/Swagger | Any |
| **tRPC** | TypeScript apps, React/Next.js | JSON/HTTP | End-to-end TS | TypeScript |
| **gRPC** | Microservices, high performance | Protobuf/HTTP/2 | Code generation | 10+ languages |

### tRPC API

EstateWise includes a **tRPC** (TypeScript Remote Procedure Call) API as an optional, type-safe alternative to the REST API. This provides end-to-end type safety between backend and frontend, automatic API client generation, and improved developer experience.

#### tRPC Features

- **End-to-End Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support from backend to frontend with automatic type inference
- **No Code Generation**: Unlike traditional API clients, tRPC infers types directly from your router
- **RPC-like DX**: Call backend functions as if they were local TypeScript functions
- **Built-in Validation**: Input/output validation using Zod schemas
- **Batching & Caching**: Automatic request batching and built-in caching support
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time subscriptions (when configured)
- **Non-Breaking**: Runs alongside existing REST API at `/trpc` endpoint

#### tRPC Router Structure

The tRPC API is organized into logical routers:

```typescript
// Main app router combining all sub-routers
appRouter = {
  properties: propertiesRouter,  // Property CRUD and search
  analytics: analyticsRouter,    // Market trends, predictions, metrics
  // Additional routers can be added here
}
```

**Properties Router** (`/trpc/properties.*`):
- `list` - Get paginated properties with filters (type, price, bedrooms)
- `byId` - Get single property by ID
- `search` - Full-text search across properties
- `create` - Create new property (protected)
- `stats` - Get aggregate statistics

**Analytics Router** (`/trpc/analytics.*`):
- `marketTrends` - Historical price/volume data for a location
- `pricePrediction` - AI-powered price estimates
- `neighborhoodInsights` - Demographics, schools, amenities
- `investmentMetrics` - ROI, cap rate, cash flow calculations

#### tRPC Architecture

```

#### tRPC Request Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant T as tRPC Endpoint
    participant V as Zod Validator
    participant P as Procedure
    participant DB as Database

    C->>T: HTTP Request to /trpc/properties.list
    T->>V: Validate Input Schema
    V-->>T: Validation Result

    alt Valid Input
        T->>P: Execute Procedure
        P->>DB: Query Data
        DB-->>P: Return Results
        P-->>T: Type-safe Response
        T-->>C: JSON with TypeScript Types
    else Invalid Input
        V-->>T: Validation Error
        T-->>C: Type-safe Error Response
    end
```

#### tRPC Type Safety

One of tRPC's main benefits is compile-time type safety:

```typescript
// ❌ TypeScript Error - 'apartament' is not a valid type
trpc.properties.list.query({ type: 'apartament' });

// ❌ TypeScript Error - 'bedroom' doesn't exist
trpc.properties.list.query({ bedroom: 3 });

// ✅ Correct - TypeScript knows all valid parameters
trpc.properties.list.query({
  type: 'apartment',
  bedrooms: 3,
  maxPrice: 750000,
});
```

**Environment Setup**:

The tRPC server requires no additional configuration beyond the standard backend `.env`. It automatically runs at `/trpc` when the backend starts.

**Testing the tRPC API**:

```bash
# Query properties
curl -G "http://localhost:3001/trpc/properties.list" \
  --data-urlencode 'input={"limit":5}'

# Get property statistics
curl "http://localhost:3001/trpc/properties.stats"

# Get market trends
curl -G "http://localhost:3001/trpc/analytics.marketTrends" \
  --data-urlencode 'input={"location":"Austin, TX","period":"month"}'
```

### gRPC Services

EstateWise also provides **gRPC** (Google Remote Procedure Call) services for high-performance, language-agnostic communication between services. This is particularly useful for microservices architectures and cross-language integrations.

#### Protocol Buffers

All gRPC services are defined using Protocol Buffers (protobuf), providing:
- **Strongly typed contracts** between services
- **Language-agnostic** service definitions
- **Efficient binary serialization** (smaller payloads than JSON)
- **Automatic client/server code generation** for multiple languages

#### Service Definitions

Our gRPC services are organized in the `grpc/` directory:

```protobuf
// grpc/protos/properties.proto
service PropertyService {
  rpc GetProperty(GetPropertyRequest) returns (Property);
  rpc ListProperties(ListPropertiesRequest) returns (PropertiesResponse);
  rpc SearchProperties(SearchRequest) returns (stream Property);
  rpc CreateProperty(CreatePropertyRequest) returns (Property);
}

// grpc/protos/analytics.proto
service AnalyticsService {
  rpc GetMarketTrends(MarketTrendsRequest) returns (MarketTrendsResponse);
  rpc PredictPrice(PricePredictionRequest) returns (PricePrediction);
  rpc StreamPriceUpdates(StreamRequest) returns (stream PriceUpdate);
}
```

```

#### gRPC Performance Benefits

- **Binary Protocol**: 20-30% smaller payloads compared to JSON
- **HTTP/2**: Multiplexing, server push, header compression
- **Streaming**: Bidirectional streaming for real-time updates
- **Code Generation**: Type-safe clients in 10+ languages
- **Load Balancing**: Built-in support for client-side load balancing

**Running the gRPC Server**:

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd grpc
npm install

# Generate TypeScript types from proto files
npm run proto:generate

# Start gRPC server (runs on port 50051)
npm run server
```

**Environment Variables**:

```env
GRPC_SERVER_PORT=50051
GRPC_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
GRPC_USE_TLS=false  # Set to true for production
GRPC_CERT_PATH=/path/to/server.crt
GRPC_KEY_PATH=/path/to/server.key
```

**Testing with grpcurl**:

```bash
# List available services
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:50051 list

# Get property by ID
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"id": "123"}' \
  localhost:50051 properties.PropertyService/GetProperty

# Stream property search
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"query": "3 bedrooms"}' \
  localhost:50051 properties.PropertyService/SearchProperties
```

**Language Support**:

The gRPC services can be consumed by clients written in:
- JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js)
- Python
- Go
- Java
- C#/.NET
- Ruby
- PHP
- And many more...

This makes EstateWise's data and services accessible to a wide range of applications and microservices, regardless of their technology stack.

## Travis CI

Travis CI complements the existing GitHub Actions workflows by running the Node 20 pipeline defined in `.travis.yml`. Each build caches npm dependencies and executes backend and frontend jobs in isolation.

- **Backend stage:** Installs dependencies with `npm --prefix backend ci`, then runs the TypeScript build and Jest suite.
- **Frontend stage:** Installs dependencies with `npm --prefix frontend ci`, performs linting, builds the Next.js app, and runs Jest.
- **Secrets:** Configure the same environment variables used locally (database URIs, Pinecone, Google AI keys, etc.) through the Travis project settings.

> [!NOTE]
> **More details:** See [`TRAVIS_CI.md`](TRAVIS_CI.md) for enablement steps, local parity commands, and maintenance tips.

## Testing

The application includes unit tests for both the backend and frontend components. These tests ensure that the application functions correctly and that any changes made do not break existing functionality.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. **Backend Unit & Integration Tests:**
  - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
  - Run the tests using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run test
    
    # or run with watch mode (recommended for development - reruns tests on file changes)
    npm run test:watch
    
    # or run with coverage report (recommended for CI/CD - generates a coverage report)
    npm run test:coverage
    ```
  - This command runs the unit tests defined in the `src/tests` directory using Jest.

2. **Frontend Unit & Integration Tests:**
  - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
  - Run the tests using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run test
    
    # or run with watch mode (recommended for development - reruns tests on file changes)
    npm run test:watch
    
    # or run with coverage report (recommended for CI/CD - generates a coverage report)
    npm run test:coverage
    ```
  - This command runs the unit tests defined in the `__tests__` directory using Jest and React Testing Library.

3. **Frontend E2E Tests:**
  - For end-to-end tests, we use Cypress and Selenium WebDriver.
  - To run the Selenium E2E tests, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm run test:selenium
    ```

  - To run the Cypress E2E tests, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm run cypress:run
    
    # to open the Cypress Test Runner in interactive mode, run:
    npm run cypress:open
    ```

  - This command runs the end-to-end tests defined in the `cypress/integration` directory using Cypress.

These tests cover various aspects of the application, including:
- **Unit Tests:** Individual components and functions to ensure they behave as expected.
- **Integration Tests:** Multiple components working together to ensure they interact correctly.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Simulating user interactions to ensure the entire application flow works as intended.

## OpenAPI Specification

An OpenAPI specification file (`openapi.yaml`) is included in the root directory. You can use Swagger UI or Postman to explore and test the API endpoints.

> [!TIP]
> Note: It may not be the latest and most updated version of the API specification, so please refer to the [Swagger API Documentation](#swagger-api-documentation) for the most up-to-date information.

## JSDoc & TypeDoc

We use **JSDoc** and **TypeDoc** to generate developer-friendly documentation for the project.

### JSDoc (for JavaScript)

1. Install:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jsdoc
   ```

2. Configure `jsdoc.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "source": {
       "include": ["backend", "frontend"],
       "includePattern": ".js$"
     },
     "opts": {
       "destination": "docs",
       "recurse": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run:

   ```bash
   npx jsdoc -c jsdoc.json
   ```

Open `docs/index.html` to view.

### TypeDoc (for TypeScript)

1. Install:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev typedoc
   ```

2. Generate backend docs:

   ```bash
   npm run typedoc:backend
   ```

3. Generate frontend docs:

   ```bash
   npm run typedoc:frontend
   ```

The generated HTML will be in `docs-backend/` and `docs-frontend/`. Open the respective `index.html` files to view.

For more details, see [jsdoc.app](https://jsdoc.app) and [typedoc.org](https://typedoc.org).

## Containerization

The application is containerized using Docker to ensure consistent, portable, and reproducible builds across different environments.

* **Backend and Frontend Dockerfiles:**
  The `backend/Dockerfile` and `frontend/Dockerfile` define how to build the container images for their respective services. They include steps to install dependencies, build the code, and configure the production servers.

* **GitHub Actions Integration:**
  As part of the CI/CD pipeline, the workflow automatically builds these Docker images after testing and linting have succeeded. It uses the `docker/build-push-action@v5` to build the images and then push them to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

* **Image Scanning:**
  Once the images are built and published, they are scanned for vulnerabilities using Trivy in the pipeline to catch any security issues before deployment.

* **docker-compose Usage (Local):**
  For local development or quick testing, a `docker-compose.yml` file is included. This file defines both the backend and frontend containers, along with their dependencies, allowing you to spin up the entire stack with a single command:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

* **Deployment:**
  In production, the images are pulled directly from GHCR and deployed to AWS infrastructure or Vercel, enabling a consistent artifact to run from local to production.

This approach ensures faster onboarding for developers, simplifies deployments, and minimizes environment drift.

## VS Code Extension

We have developed a VSCode extension to enhance the development experience with **EstateWise**. This extension provides features such as:

- **Instant Chat Access**  
  Open the EstateWise chatbot directly in VS Code via the Command Palette (`Estatewise Chat: Open Chat`).

- **Persistent Webview Panel**  
  Keeps your conversation context alive even when the panel is hidden or you switch files.

- **Configurable Panel**  
  Customize the panel title, target editor column, iframe width/height, script permissions, and auto‑open behavior via VS Code settings.

- **Secure Embedding**  
  Loads the chatbot through a sandboxed iframe with a strict Content‑Security‑Policy, so all logic remains safely hosted on `https://estatewise.vercel.app/chat`.

- **Zero Backend Overhead**  
  No extra server or API keys required in VS Code—everything runs through the existing EstateWise web app.

- **Easy Installation**  
  Install the `.vsix` package locally or grab it from the VS Code Marketplace, then start chatting with EstateWise without leaving your editor.
